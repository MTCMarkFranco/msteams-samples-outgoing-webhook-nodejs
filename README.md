# Microsoft Teams outgoing webhook sample

This project is an implementation of a very simple [Outgoing Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot) for Microsoft Teams. All it does is verify that what's sending messages matches the Outgoing Webhook that was created in Teams, and it echoes back whatever is sent to it.

## Steps to run locally

### Prerequisites

* Install Git for windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io/

* Clone this repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/msteams-samples-outgoing-webhook-nodejs.git
  ```

* Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/    

* Create and install your own Certificate files required for SSL communication with Teams, located within the Certs folder

* Paste the security token generated by Teams as the value of `TeamsSharedSecret` in `.ENV`. 

* In the directory in which you installed this project, type `npm start`

* In Microsoft Teams, in any channel in the team in which you created the Outgoing Webhook, you can type `@<botname> hello` (or anything else you like) and it will echo back its name and what you typed.
